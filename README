ofxFBOMovieClip & ofxFBOImageSequenceLoader are a set of helper classes for loading and controlling image sequences as FBO textures. These were created to add simple timeline control similar to Flash ( play(), stop(), gotoAndPlay(), etc ). Works with Openframeworks 007.

CREDIT
ofxFBOImageSequenceLoader is similar to and inspired by FlightPhase's http://www.flightphase.com ofxImageSequence.

SAMPLE USAGE

// below would load 11 images from "horses/frame00.png" - "horses/frame10.png"
// parameters: frame label, total images, path to images, image type, number of digits for the count (eg. 3 = 001, 2 = 01), count start (if your first image file is "horses/frame00.png" then start at 0) 
ofxFBOImageSequenceLoader fis;
fis.loadAndCreateSequence("horseWalk", 11, "horses/frame", "png", 2, 0);

// initialise a movie clip, passing a reference to the ofxFBOImageSequenceLoader, and desired frame rate for the image sequence
ofxFBOMovieClip mc;
mc.init(&fis, 30.0f);

// control the movie clip timeline from keyboard events/mouse events etc.
mc.gotoAndPlay("horseWalk");

// in your main draw loop
mc.drawFrame(0, 0);

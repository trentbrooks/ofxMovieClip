ofxFBOMovieClip & ofxFBOImageSequenceLoader are a set of helper classes for loading and controlling image sequences as FBO textures. These were created to add simple timeline control similar to Flash ( play(), stop(), gotoAndPlay(), etc ).

CREDIT
ofxFBOImageSequenceLoader is similar to and inspired by FlightPhase's http://www.flightphase.com ofxImageSequence.
